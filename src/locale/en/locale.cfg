[mod-setting-description]

inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled=The types of inserters for which runtime handling is done.\nThe prototype flag allow_burner_leech is always enabled for all inserters regardless of this setting.
inserter-fuel-leech-discover-per-tick=(Re)Discovers this many inserters already existing on the map per tick.\nIncrease when using mods creating lots of inserters you want to be handled without raising the appropriate events.\nLeave at 1 otherwise. Setting this to zero will not help UPS issues even when playing on a potato.
inserter-fuel-leech-discover-empty-chunks-per-tick=Maximally skip this many empty chunks per tick when (re)discovering inserters.\nThis is mostly a debug setting. The default should be fine on any system.
inserter-fuel-leech-self-leech-from-drop-enabled=If a burner inserter needs fuel, it might take it from its drop target in addition to taking it from the pickup target.
inserter-fuel-leech-self-refuel-cheat-enabled=If a burner inserter gets stuck out of fuel and it has fuel in its hand or its pickup target or drop target has fuel, one item of that fuel is teleported into the inserters fuel inventory.
inserter-fuel-leech-target-item-count-min=The amount of items to maintain in the target inventory. Vanilla inserter behavior is to insert 5 fuel items into non-vehicle fuel inventories.
inserter-fuel-leech-pickup-margin-ticks=Inserters will teleport fuel items into their hand up to this amount of ticks early from their pickup target or late from their drop target. If this is too low, the inserter may already have picked up another item or miss the opportunity to leech from a drop target when timing estimates are off.

inserter-fuel-leech-no-use-for-fuel-seconds-to-wait=Seconds to wait before next update when the inserter or its target don't use fuel items.\nThis also is the reaction delay for changing the inserter drop target.\nIncrease this first when experiencing UPS lag.
inserter-fuel-leech-missing-resource-seconds-to-wait=Seconds to wait before next update when the inserter is supposed to get fuel for itself or its target, but there is no fuel to pick up.\nThis also is the reaction delay for when fuel items become available.\nIncrease this when experiencing UPS lag because of notoriously underfueled smelter columns.
inserter-fuel-leech-missing-power-seconds-to-wait=Seconds to wait before next update when an inserter not burning fuel items is unpowered.\nThis also is the reaction delay for when electricity (or fluids for some modded inserters) is restored.\nIncrease this when experiencing UPS lag in factories that make heavy use of power switches or modded fluid-powered inserters.
inserter-fuel-leech-vanilla-self-refuel-seconds-to-wait=Seconds to wait before next update when an inserter burning fuel items has no fuel items and can refuel from a burner inventory at the pickup location (standard engine behavior) [s]
inserter-fuel-leech-wait-variation-seconds=Maximum duration in seconds to add to the previous wait durations to help spreading the update load evenly.\nIncrease this if experiencing recurring UPS spikes in an interval that matches one of the other settings for some time after building lots of inserters in a short time frame.\nIncreasing this doesn't help when UPS is continously below 60.

inserter-fuel-leech-chat-log-color=
inserter-fuel-leech-log-low-traffic=Print a message into the chat for rare events like a state (re)initialization.
inserter-fuel-leech-log-discovery-cycle=Print a message into the chat when an inserter (re)discovery cycle ended.
inserter-fuel-leech-watch-last-inserter=Spams your personal chat with loads of messages for the last-built inserter meant to aid in debugging of this mod's control script.\nThe watched inserter is the last built by you. Build and remove an inserter to stop watching.

inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled-none=None
inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled-itemfueled=Item-fueled burner inserters

[string-mod-setting-description]

inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled-none=No runtime handling for any inserter. Near-zero UPS impact.
inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled-itemfueled=Runtime handling for item-fueled burner inserters. Performance cost depends on amount of such inserters.
inserter-fuel-leech-inserters-enabled-all=Runtime handling for all inserters. Highest performance cost.
