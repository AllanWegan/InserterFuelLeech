[mod-setting-description]

inserter-fuel-leech-min-fuel-items=Inserters leech appropriate fuel items from pickup target's burner inventories until a drop target's burner inventory holds at least this amount of items.\nDefault is 5.

inserter-fuel-leech-ticks-between-updates=Each tick, N / T inserters get updated where N is the count of placed inserters in the game and T is the value of this setting. If N < T, one inserter gets checked every tick. If increasing this, you might also want to increase "Maximum pickup distance variation".\nThe value is a tradeoff between impact on UPS for big amounts of inserters and reliability of detection of an inserter's hand hovering above its pickup target. Too high values lead to starved drop targets. Too low values will kill UPS if lots of inserters are managed.\nDefault is 90 (1.5 seconds at normal game speed with full UPS).

inserter-fuel-leech-pickup-pos-variation=Maximum distance (measured in tiles) between the hand of an inserter and its pickup location to consider it hovering over its pickup target. Keep this small to prevent visible teleporting of items.\nSet this to 10.0 to get BurnerLeech's teleport-to-hand behaviour.\nDefault is 0.3.

inserter-fuel-leech-self-refuel-cheat-enabled=Every once in a while, out-of-fuel burner inserters get a minuscule amount of free fuel. This allows them to grab more fuel from their pickup location and get themselves properly fueled.\n
