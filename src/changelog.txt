Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2018-01-31
  Info:
    - First version of the fork.
    - Compatible with Factorio 0.16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2018-01-31
  Features:
    - Inserters now leech fuel from all entities containing a burner (including locomotives and burner inserters).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2019-03-15
  Info:
    - Version bump for Factorio 0.17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2020-02-10
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that inserters might grab fuel for wich their target has no room because all slots contain other fuel items.
  Features:
    - Self refuel cheat if enabled (the default), now once in a while fuels unpowered burner inserters with a minuscule amount of free fuel. This fully removes the need to manually feed burner inserters ever again. They slowly fix themselves. The out-of-power-icon keeps flashing until the inserter has itself properly fueled again.
  Info:
    - Version bump for Factorio 0.18.
    - Non-cheating self-fueling code replaced with new allow_burner_leech property on burner inserter prototypes to improve performance and reliability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2020-02-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed missing call to initSettingsCache() in on_configuration_changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 2020-05-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed fuel cheat trying to feed inserters items in their fuel category wich have a fuel value of 0. If you defined such an item, please fix your mod too. Items having a fuel category should also have a positive fuel value.
  Info:
    - Synced README with mod portal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 2020-12-14
  Info:
    - Version bump for Factorio 1.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.7
Date: 2022-10-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed scripted entity ghost revive, entity build or entity clone not detected by listening to (hopefully) all the various events regarding entity creation (including script_raised_revive used by "Nanobots: Early Bots").
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-01-19
  Info:
    - Full rewrite from the ground up for less UPS impact and more robustness.
    - Fully Space Age compatible (but doesn't require Space Age).
    - More accurate prediction of when the inserter hand is over the pickup target again.
      Inserters less often pick up other stuff when they actually need to refuel themselves or their drop target.
    - Eventual inserter discovery loop to find inserters built by other mods without raising the appropriate events.
    - The refuel cheat doesn't create power from thin air anymore.\n
      First, the inserter's held items are checked.\n
      Then an item is searched at the pickup location (burner inventory, normal inventory, belt lane or tile).\n
      And last, an item is searched at the drop location (burner inventory, normal inventory, belt lane or tile).\n
      If an item is found, it is teleported into the inserter burner inventory.\n
    - Inserters also leech fuel for themselves from drop target.\n
      This is unreliable for now, but still good enough for low traffic with cheat refueling enabled.\n
    - Admin chat command /iflreset to reset the mod state and rediscover all inserters immediately.
    - Chat command /iflstats to print some statistics about the known inserters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2025-11-02
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed ring buffer length calculation (was larger than needed).
    - Fixed continous inserter (re)discovery performance degradation on surfaces with large numbers of generated chunks independent from inserter count.\n
      Changed discovery from getting inserter lists per surface to getting them per chunk.\n
      UPS cost for discovery is now almost independent of the size of the discovered area on each surface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2025-11-09
  Features:
    - Implemented maintaining a desired minimum drop target fuel item count mimicking non-leeching vanilla inserter behavior.
      Inserters still always grab full hands when available and space in drop target inventory allows.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed newly placedburner inserters taking the unpowered amount of time before first trying to fuel their drop target from their pickup source.
      There now is a separate setting for the seconds to wait when waiting for the engine to refuel an inserter. The default is 2.
