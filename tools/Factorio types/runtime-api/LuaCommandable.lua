---@field moving_state defines.moving_state
---The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

---@field parent_group? LuaCommandable
---Current position of this commandable.
---
---If commandable is a UnitGroup, this can have different meanings depending on the group state. When the group is gathering, the position is the place of gathering. When the group is moving, the position is the expected position of its members along the path. When the group is attacking, it is the average position of its members.

---@field unique_id uint
---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
