---
---```
----- called on a LuaTrain with 3 locomotives, it returns 3 LuaEntities:
---train.locomotives -- => {front_movers = {loco1, loco2}, back_movers = {loco3}}
---```
---@field locomotives LuaTrain.locomotives
---When `true`, the train is explicitly controlled by the player or script. When `false`, the train moves autonomously according to its schedule.

---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
