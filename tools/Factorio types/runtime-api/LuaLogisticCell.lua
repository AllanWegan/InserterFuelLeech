---Logistic cell of a particular [LuaEntity](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaEntity.html). A "Logistic Cell" is the given name for settings and properties used by what would normally be seen as a "Roboport". A logistic cell however doesn't have to be attached to the roboport entity (the character has one for the personal roboport).

---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
