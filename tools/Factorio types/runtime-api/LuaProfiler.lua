---An object used to measure script performance.
---
---Since performance is non-deterministic, these objects don't allow reading the raw time values from Lua. They can be used anywhere a [LocalisedString](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/concepts.html#LocalisedString) is used, except for [LuaGuiElement::add](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaGuiElement.html#add)'s LocalisedString arguments, [LuaSurface::create\_entity](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaSurface.html#create_entity)'s `text` argument, and [LuaEntity::add\_market\_item](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaEntity.html#add_market_item).

---@class LuaProfiler:LuaObject
---The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

---@field object_name string
---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
