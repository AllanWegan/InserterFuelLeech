---Teleport the entity to a given position, possibly on another surface.
---
---Some entities may not be teleported. For instance, transport belts won't allow teleportation and this method will always return `false` when used on any such entity.
---
---You can also pass 1 or 2 numbers as the parameters and they will be used as relative teleport coordinates `'teleport(0, 1)'` to move the entity 1 tile positive y. `'teleport(4)'` to move the entity 4 tiles to the positive x.
---
---`script_raised_teleported` will not be raised if teleporting a player with no character.
