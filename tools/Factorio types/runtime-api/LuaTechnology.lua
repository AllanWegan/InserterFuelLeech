---@class LuaTechnology:LuaObject
---Can this technology be researched?
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#enabled)
---@field enabled boolean
---The force this technology belongs to.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#force)
---@field force LuaForce
---The current level of this technology. For level-based technology writing to this is the same as researching the technology to the previous level. Writing the level will set [LuaTechnology::enabled](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#enabled) to `true`.

---@field localised_name LocalisedString
---Name of this technology.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#name)
---@field name string
---The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#object_name)
---@field object_name string
---The string used to alphabetically sort these prototypes. It is a simple string that has no additional semantic meaning.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#order)
---@field order string
---Prerequisites of this technology. The result maps technology name to the [LuaTechnology](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html) object.

---@field prototype LuaTechnologyPrototype
---The number of research units required for this technology.
---
---This is multiplied by the current research cost multiplier, unless [LuaTechnologyPrototype::ignore\_tech\_cost\_multiplier](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnologyPrototype.html#ignore_tech_cost_multiplier) is `true`.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#research_unit_count)
---@field research_unit_count uint
---The count formula, if this research has any. See [TechnologyUnit::count\_formula](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/types/TechnologyUnit.html#count_formula) for details.

---@field research_unit_ingredients (Ingredient)[]
---Has this technology been researched? Switching from `false` to `true` will trigger the technology advancement perks; switching from `true` to `false` will reverse them.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#researched)
---@field researched boolean
---Saved technology progress fraction as a value in range `[0, 1)`. 0 means there is no saved progress.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#saved_progress)
---@field saved_progress double
---Successors of this technology, i.e. technologies which have this technology as a prerequisite.

---@field successors {[string]:LuaTechnology}
---Is this an upgrade-type research?
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnology.html#upgrade)
---@field upgrade boolean
---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
