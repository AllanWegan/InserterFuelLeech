---Effects applied when this technology is researched.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnologyPrototype.html#effects)
---@field effects (TechnologyModifier)[]
---If this technology prototype is enabled by default (enabled at the beginning of a game).

---@field essential boolean
---If this technology ignores the technology cost multiplier setting.
---
---[LuaTechnologyPrototype::research\_unit\_count](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnologyPrototype.html#research_unit_count) will already take this setting into account.

---@field successors {[string]:LuaTechnologyPrototype}
---If the is technology prototype is an upgrade to some other technology.
---
---[View Documentation](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaTechnologyPrototype.html#upgrade)
---@field upgrade boolean
---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
